Fruit * apple // Pointer-> can have null value, not necessary to always hold a value
Fruit & seed //by reference -> must always have value

^Both pointer and reference will allow user to use the variable in another class

Fruit loop //Most basic initialization -> will be destroyed when the class it belongs to is destroyed, will not be used in another class
